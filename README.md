Making the best use of internet's bandwidth by detecting traffic through Bassa's algorithms on a browser extension

## What is BassaExtension?
BassaExtension is an add on feature which can be installed on browsers with just a few clicks. So you no longer have to specifically setup, install and open an application if you're just looking for an appropriate time to complete your downloads.

## How does it help?
The BassaExtension works on the principles of Bassa, and thus uses its algorithms to generate a <b>Traffic-Time</b> graph to inform the user about the appropriate timings when a download can be done. It can tell you about when is it better to download stuff from the internet to make the best use of your internet's bandwidth.<br>
<b>Lower the traffic, Higher the efficiency. Higher the traffic, Lower the efficiency</b>
