Currently in progress. This is a demo of a potential project for SCoRe Labs with no dynamic functions as of now...

Making the best use of internet's bandwidth by detecting traffic through Bassa's algorithms on a browser extension

## What is BassaExtension?
BassaExtension is a chrome add on feature inspired by [Bassa - A SCoRe's repository](https://github.com/scorelab/Bassa) which can be installed on browsers with just a few clicks. So you no longer have to specifically setup, install and open an application if you're just looking for an appropriate time to complete your downloads.

## Working
The BassaExtension works on the principles of Bassa, and thus uses its algorithms to generate a <b>Traffic-Time</b> graph to inform the user about the appropriate timings when a download can be done. It can tell you about when is it better to download stuff from the internet to make the best use of your internet's bandwidth.<br>
<b>Lower the traffic, Higher the efficiency. Higher the traffic, Lower the efficiency</b>

As mentioned above, an empty <b>Traffic-Time</b> graph would look somewhat like this:

In the following graph, a <b>bar like notation</b> would be present which would indicate the current Internet's bandwidth or Traffic. So you can just look at the bar on the <b>Traffic-Time</b> graph and know exactly when you have to download something.

And ofcourse, there is no need to keep opening the extension. Just turn it on, and you'll automatically be notified of the appropriate download time. We'll notice the graph on your behalf ;)
